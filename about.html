                <p class="aboutText">Born and raised in Southern Denmark, with a passion for drums and different
                sounds in his environment, he took to rap and wrote hos first lyrics in the very young age of 8.
                In 2012 he made his first stage debut in a Danish television show and from there, he continued to perform
                until 2016, where he took a break to spend time improving his sound. In 2017 the singer wrote his first alternative
                RnB/pop song - Tied -and subsequently to a bunch of singles unreleased.
                Crimson Marks focus on the right melody in the lyrics, the rhymes and lines in every song, no matter the beat
                and genre. He draws his inspiration in the highly popular genres of the hip hop and RnB environment and
                continuely tries to improve the stage and culture, performing for the modern audience. The lyrics are always
                based off of real events to maintain the important connection between artist and listener.</p>
